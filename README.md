## About

This is a React project created to learn a lot of React concepts, so it is front-end only. First, it includes React router with prop-handling and prop-drilling; also, included prop-types to handle inputs. The albums are loaded by fetching LastFM's API data so it includes many sections, including rock genre's and an own search section. The application has an own "cart" in which the user can store albums and "buy" albums; currently deployed on Vercel.

In this web-app we can:

* Search albums by genre and by input.
* Select multiple albums to store in a cart.
* View the selected albums on an own "Cart" component, with the feature to remove any album selected.
* Calculate prices and "buy" all albums.
